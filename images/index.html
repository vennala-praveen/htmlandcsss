    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>

    <p>If you enjoy specialty coffee, you are probably familiar with the process of buying coffee fresh from a coffee roaster or buying coffee that is roasted to order. This also means that you are likely to have seen the term ‘house blend’ used to describe particular coffee beans provided by roasteries and coffee brands.
        In modern specialty coffee, the term ‘house blend’ simply refers to a bag of coffee beans that contain a blend of various coffee bean varieties and origins, curated into one blend by the coffee roaster.

    <p>Pour coarse ground coffee into the carafe, then fill it with boiling water before giving it a quick stir. After waiting for four minutes for the coffee to steep, put the lid on and slowly press the plunger down to separate the grounds from the coffee. Serve immediately (or transfer to a separate carafe), as the coffee will continue to brew and get more bitter if allowed to sit in the press for too long.</p>

    <h2>Home Make Tea</h2>

    <p>Tea, my curious friend, is a fascinating concoction drawn from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, a plant that seems to be touched by divine powers (at least for us tea-obsessives). This magical leaf, when steeped in hot water, permeates its essence, transforming into a comforting brew. This blend, depending on the type of leaf and process it went through, can vary from a calming mild infusion to a robust burst of flavor.
        Imagine our humble tea as a chameleon, constantly changing its color and flavor based on a variety of factors. Sounds wild, right? Welcome to the world of tea!</p>
